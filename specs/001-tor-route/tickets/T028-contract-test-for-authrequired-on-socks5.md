# T028: Contract test for `AUTH_REQUIRED` on SOCKS5 path

## Context

Derived from `specs/001-tor-route/tasks.md` — see the full task body there. This
ticket is the executable work unit; the tasks.md entry is the
spec-kit plan that survives `/speckit-tasks` regeneration.

> **Full task body (verbatim from tasks.md):**
>
> Contract test for `AUTH_REQUIRED` on SOCKS5 path — exact 2-byte response `0x01 0xFF` then close, no additional bytes — in `tests/contract/socks5/auth_required_test.go` — per research.md §9 and `contracts/socks5-auth.md` §"Auth failure response".

## Analysis

*(Required — `privacy_critical: true`. Fill at `/start` per
`docs/process/analysis.md`.)*

## Acceptance

*(Derive from the spec at `/start` — see `docs/process/ticket-template.md`
for the preferred shapes: named test, behavioral assertion, runnable command.)*

## Out-of-scope

*(Fill at `/start` if the task body references exclusions or other tickets' work.)*

## Notes

Derived by `scripts/bootstrap-tickets.sh` on 2026-07-04.
