# T070: Integration test `tests/integration/error_template_test.go`

## Context

Derived from `specs/001-tor-route/tasks.md` — see the full task body there. This
ticket is the executable work unit; the tasks.md entry is the
spec-kit plan that survives `/speckit-tasks` regeneration.

> **Full task body (verbatim from tasks.md):**
>
> Integration test `tests/integration/error_template_test.go` — end-to-end version of T065: bring up the stack, stop the Tor sidecar mid-session, request a `.onion` URL through the data plane, capture the full response, run the leak-corpus scan.

## Analysis

*(Required — `privacy_critical: true`. Fill at `/start` per
`docs/process/analysis.md`.)*

## Acceptance

*(Derive from the spec at `/start` — see `docs/process/ticket-template.md`
for the preferred shapes: named test, behavioral assertion, runnable command.)*

## Out-of-scope

*(Fill at `/start` if the task body references exclusions or other tickets' work.)*

## Notes

Derived by `scripts/bootstrap-tickets.sh` on 2026-07-04.
